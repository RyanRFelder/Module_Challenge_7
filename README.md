# Module_Challenge_7
 
 This project performs a financial analysis on an ETF holding GOST,GS,PYPL, and SQ. 
 The daily returns for the stocks have been compared and analyzed individually as well as considering their part in the whole portfolio.
 Initially, Paypal's stock performance was analyzed using SQL queries to a database containing historical price data for the stocks. 
 Subsequently, the SQL queries are improved/optimized. 
 
I have also added a couple of screenshots of the application running via Voila, in the local host. (trying to add pics to the readme)
